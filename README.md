# Browser Platform Publisher

Use this action to publish your browser extension to every web store/add-ons marketplace. This action and its dependencies are fully open source under the MIT license. The core modules are:

- [Browser Market Submit](https://github.com/plasmo-corp/bms)
- [Mozilla Webstore Upload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@plasmo-corp/mwu)
- [Chrome Webstore Upload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@plasmo-corp/cwu)
- [Edge Webstore Upload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@plasmo-corp/ewu)

The action is updated regularly and is field-tested in [cex](https://github.com/plasmo-corp/cex/actions)

## Usage

First, create a `keys.json` in your favorite text editor (preferably one that supports [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/)):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plasmo-corp/bpp/v2/keys.schema.json"
}
```

A sample template is provided in [`keys.template.json`](./keys.template.json), and the JSON schema is in [`keys.schema.json`](./keys.schema.json). If your editor supports [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/), it should give you intellisense/autocompletion while working on the keys.

**NOTE**: You should only specify the browser you wish to publish to. If there are any invalid configuration, the action will fail! I.e, no empty key allowed such as `"chrome": {}`.

Copy the content of your `keys.json` into a github secret with a name of your choosing, in this case we used `BPP_KEYS`. Then, the action can be used as follows:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Browser Platform Publish
    uses: plasmo-corp/bpp@v2
    with:
      keys: ${{ secrets.BPP_KEYS }}
```

**NOTE**: If you're publishing to the Opera store, you will need to set up Chromium for puppeteer before running `bpp`. In v3, we will hopefully deprecate the Puppeteer approach altogether (since it's quite a leaky abstraction), or have an option for BPP to download and set up the browser for you.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup Chrome
    uses: browser-actions/setup-chrome@latest
    with:
      chrome-version: latest
  - name: Browser Platform Publish
    uses: plasmo-corp/bpp@v2
    env:
      PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH: /opt/hostedtoolcache/chromium/latest/x64/chrome
    with:
      keys: ${{ secrets.BPP_KEYS }}
```

**NOTE**: If you skipped the `zip` parameter in your keys, and that your extension artifact is understood by the browser you specified, you can specify an `artifact` action parameter:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Browser Platform Publish
    uses: plasmo-corp/bpp@v2
    with:
      artifact: build/artifact.zip
      keys: ${{ secrets.BPP_KEYS }}
```

This works if you're targeting a group of browsers that share a similar format, such as Chrome or Edge.
